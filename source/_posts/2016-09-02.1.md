Exactly one year ago we launched Salaam Swipe with the commitment to change the way we meet. It has been an incredible journey for us as we work to achieve that mission. Like you, we are constantly growing and learning. Everything we've learnt over this past year just went into Version 2.0 of Salaam Swipe!

**I'm not exaggerating when I say this: we just launched the MOST advanced Muslim matching application on the market and this time it's on Android too!** <!-- More -->

All you existing users, I want to thank you for believing in Salaam Swipe. We're expecting a lot of growth with our newest version of the app and with all the growth, I want to take a moment to let you know that I, and all of us here at Salaam Swipe, will not forget those initial users who took this journey with us. 

Lastly, if you know someone who might benefit from Salaam Swipe share this article with them!
