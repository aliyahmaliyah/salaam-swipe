Hello, Windy City!

Guess what?! We're at the [Islamic Society of North America](http://www.isna.net/annual-convention.html)’s annual convention in Chicago celebrating the launch [Salaam Swipe 2.0](http://www.salaamswipe.com/#app)! 

The ISNA convention is the largest gathering of Muslims in North America. With over 30,000 attendants yearly, it's the perfect place for us to tell everyone about how We’re Changing the Way We Meet One Another! <!-- More -->

We’ll be attending a ton of different events during the convention chatting about our mission to connect Muslims. Follow along on Twitter with [#ISNA53](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ISNA53&src=tyah) and make sure you find us to say hi. We'll be the ones wearing the Salaam Swipe t-shirts. 

And don't forget to download our latest and greatest update of Salaam Swipe! It is highly optimized which means it works faster than cupids arrow. The new design is slick and fresh with better quality pictures and even better matches.
